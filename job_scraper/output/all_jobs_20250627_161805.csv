Our first product, Read with Ello, is an AI reading teacher that listens to children read out loud. Ello uses speech recognition to help them when they get stuck, makes up stories using generative AI, and inspires a love for reading. We’re now building on the success of Read with Ello and putting together the pieces of the world’s first complete AI teacher for all children. Together, we believe we can close the primary school education gap worldwide. Ello has been recognized on Fortune’s “Change the World” and Time’s 2024 Best Inventions lists. We are well-funded, backed by world-class investors, and ready to recruit new talent to help us achieve our vision. Who You’ll Be Joining Ello is a rapidly growing, series A startup focused on revolutionizing the way children learn and interact with technology. You will work directly with Ello’s Co-founder & CTO, Catalin Voss, on a small team (<10) of engineers, learning designers, and PMs to develop new products.

About The Role We’re looking for a strong  Senior Design Engineer, New Products  to independently own the build-out of learning activities as part of Ello’s next-generation AI tutoring apps. You will bridge the gap between product development and engineering to own features from conception to playtest, at times acting as your own product manager, and at times collaborating closely with our product team. You’ll be part of a small team that is responsible for bringing Ello’s tutoring AI to life through agent control, character development, and game interactions. You pay attention to the details and thrive building products that delight users.

On the frontend, you’re able to take an existing component library and build a rough UI from scratch (Flutter & React) without a designer or implement pixel-perfect layouts in collaboration with a designer. We welcome candidates from all backgrounds – mobile engineering, machine learning, or design & product – but we prioritize strong technical foundations and demonstrated execution speed in shipping. As an ideal candidate, you’ll have built and shipped software products end-to-end in the past, for example through an initiative you championed at a prior job, through an impressive side project, or as the founder of your own company.

For example, you see how small changes in a character’s facial expression or the shading of a background affect the emotional impact of the end product   Demonstrated bias to action in product building: creating something from nothing and turning chaos into order   Demonstrated ability to work within existing design systems and brand standards to build new front-end components   Cross-functional skills; you likely either picked up engineering from a product/design domain or product skills from a computer science background   Familiarity with project management tools and collaborative development tools         Nice To Have Experience   Experience with game development   Experience as a product manager or in a role with significant ownership over features or components   Deep understanding of mobile app architecture, design patterns, and performance optimization techniques   Experience with designing products for children       We Look For Candidates Who   Have something to teach us   Want to do work they are proud of to ship products they are proud of   Have an urge to make a real impact on child development at scale   Take initiative and full ownership of their work   Prefer open and direct communication grounded in empathy to beating around the bush   Exemplify integrity in their actions, decisions, and communication   Want to build meaningful relationships at work       Here are some reasons to be a part of our team   Dive deep into the rapidly evolving world of AI and interactive learning.

Together, we believe we can close the primary school education gap worldwide. Ello has been recognized on Fortune’s “Change the World” and Time’s 2024 Best Inventions lists. We are well-funded, backed by world-class investors, and ready to recruit new talent to help us achieve our vision. Who You’ll Be Joining Ello’s 5-person Machine Learning team includes some of the world’s foremost experts in their areas. To give one example, our speech perception efforts are led by the co-authors of wav2vec. At Ello, they’ve built the world’s best child speech recognition system, beating Whisper. That ability to understand child speech reliably enables us to unlock the power of generative AI tools for early childhood learning. We work on a broad range of machine learning problems across multimodal machine learning, NLP, image generation, and speech perception. We collaborate closely with advisors from Stanford and top industry research labs (on a weekly basis, not in some hands-off way).

We want to have fun while working hard to do impactful things that we’re proud of – and we believe it’s possible to do both.
